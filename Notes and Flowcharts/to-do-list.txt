to do: 
- check SD card writes
- make and insert DataLog.csv into sd card
- check timestamps
- check that while(1) or return; function with brian
- check that timer for the else if's in warning message functions (maybe use while(1)?)
- git ignore for adafruit io key
- mq-9
- put neopixel functions under associated warning messages
- maybe add a subscribe function as an interrupt 
- IFTTT

flow for the loop(so far):

mqttconnect
synctime
buttonState for pixelstate
LEDbrightness
